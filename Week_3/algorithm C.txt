#Algorithm that takes as input two names and their corresponding age and then swap the ages
input both names as name_1 & name_2
input both ages as age_1 & age_2
print (your ages will be swapped now!)
print (name_1 is age_1) using "f" function and {} brackets
print (name_2 is age_2) using "f" function and {} brackets
print (your ages would be swapped now)
print (name_1 is age_2) using "f" function and {} brackets
print (name_2 is age_1) using "f" function and {} brackets
